## Fetch dataset:
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. The following image is an example screenshot of what appears when a user visits [this link](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

## Imported and visualize the data by doing the following:
Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Note: Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth will appear darker in color.

* Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
* Includes a legend that will provide context for your map data.
